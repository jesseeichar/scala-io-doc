    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Examples for creating Output/Input/ReadChars/WriteChars/etc using the asFooConverter pattern.  There are two patterns for creating IO objects.  One is using the Resources API.  This is often the best for creating resources from closeable objects such as InputStreams.  The Resource API takes a code block for constructing the resource and can there for recreate the resource when needed.  <br></br> The other pattern is to convert an existing object to an Input/Ouput/ReadChars/WriteChars/Seekable object.  The idea here is to import the implicit conversions contained in the target object (Input/Ouput/ReadChars/WriteChars/Seekable) and then call the asInput/asOuput/asReadChars/asWriteChars/asSeekable.  <br></br> Examples of the latter pattern are described here.  <br></br> Note: In all examples where a codec is required, the codec can be explicitly or implicitly passed </span></span></div>
