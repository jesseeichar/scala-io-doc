    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Demonstrate the limited/controlled fold of LongTraversable.  <p> The limitFold method allows one to fold over a LongTraversable but terminate the traversal at any arbitrary point.  This is not as powerful as the Iteree pattern but is easy to get into if one is familiar with fold </p> </span></span></div>
