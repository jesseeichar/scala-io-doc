    // Output processor are used when one needs to perform batch writes on an output object
    // When a processor object is used a &quot;processing&quot; pipeline is created and the operations
    // are performed in batch form.
    // The following example will write 2 lines to the output object (a file in this case)
    // there are a few ways to use outputProcessors.  Following are a few patterns

    // This next example is the pattern most developers will likely be most comfortable with:
    for{
      // create a processor (signalling the start of a batch process)
      processor &lt;- output.outputProcessor
      // create an output object from it
      out = processor.asOutput
    }{
      // all writes to out will be on the same open output stream/channel
      out.write(&quot;first write\n&quot;)
      out.write(&quot;second write&quot;)
    }

    // At first glance the next example seems odd
    // but it does the same as the last example
    for{
        // create the processor
        out &lt;- output.outputProcessor
        // perform write calls
        // but realize that the writes do not occur until
        // the processor are executed (see next example for that)
        _ &lt;- out.write(&quot;first write\n&quot;)
        _ &lt;- out.write(&quot;second write&quot;)
    } {} // Nothing yields so the processor executes and the 2 lines are written

    // The next example creates a processing pipeline and then executes it
    val processor: Processor[Unit] = for{
        // create the processor
        out &lt;- output.outputProcessor
        // perform write calls
        _ &lt;- out.write(&quot;first write\n&quot;)
        _ &lt;- out.write(&quot;second write&quot;)
    } yield {}
    // at this point the writes have not occurred because processor contains the
    // processing pipeline

    processor.execute  // execute processor

    // Why use the processor style writes? because it processors have both read and
    // write components.  Write processors allow reading and writing to be interleaved
    val processor2: Processor[TraversableOnce[Unit]] = for{
        in &lt;- Resource.fromURL(&quot;http://scala-lang.org&quot;).lines().processor
        out &lt;- output.outputProcessor
        // This examples how the writes can be interleaved with reads, which is not possible if the output operations
        // did not return processors
        _ &lt;- out.write(&quot;writing scala-lang\n&quot;)
        lineNum &lt;- in.repeatUntilEmpty()
