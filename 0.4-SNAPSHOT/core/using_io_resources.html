    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> The typical IO objects are java IO objects converted into Resource objects using the Resource object's factory methods.  Once a Resource has been created there are methods for converting between them.  <p> The following examples demonstrate using the Resource objects and converting between them.  </p><p> All resources are also Seekable, Input, Output, ReadChars and/or WriteChars so all normal IO operations are possible but the following examples are Resource only operations</p> </span></span></div>

    val resource = Resource.fromInputStream(new FileInputStream(&quot;file&quot;))

    // data is read from the input
