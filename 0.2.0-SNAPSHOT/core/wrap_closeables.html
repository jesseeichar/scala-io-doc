    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Wrap any closeable resources with a Resource.  The scala-arm resource.managed method can be used to wrap many types of objects (like Closeable or jdbc connections) with the ARM (Automatic Resource Management) functionality which handles closing the resource after use.  <p> For common IO it is recommended to use a specific Resource.fromFoo methods so that the convenient methods of bytes, chars, copy, etc...  are available for use.  But for other things like jdbc connections or RandomAccessFiles resource.managed is useful.  </p> </span></span></div>

    import java.io.RandomAccessFile

    val fileResource = _root_.resource.managed(new RandomAccessFile(&quot;foo.txt&quot;,&quot;rw&quot;))

    // now resource can be used using acquire etc... with the confidence that the resource will
    // be closed when done

    // acquireAndGet will make the request but any exceptions will be thrown when encountered
    val length:Long = fileResource.acquireAndGet(_.length)

    // If you want to handle the possible errors then acquireFor is what you want
