    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Create a sliding 'window' on the underlying data.  The sliding method is part of the LongTraversable in order to permit easy processing of the data in chunks rather than one byte at a time.  An alternative would be to use foldLeft and manage the buffer of data manually but sliding reduces the complexity of performing such operations.  <p> For example, suppose every 1000 bytes is a logical block and each block has a checksum of 8 bytes at the end of the 1000 bytes.  The following would provide one method of processing such a file </p> </span></span></div>

    import scalax.io._

    val file1 = Resource.fromFile(&quot;file1&quot;)

    // use sliding to visit each 1008 bytes.
    // map splits the window into two parts, block and checksum
    // NOTE:  Data is not loaded from the resource until foreach
    // or some other method that triggers the actual access of the data
    val blocks = file1.bytes.sliding(1008,1008).map{_ splitAt 1000}

    // grouped is sliding(size,size) so the following is equivalent
    val blocks2 = file1.bytes.grouped(1008).map{_ splitAt 1000}

    blocks foreach {
      case (block,checksum) =&gt;
