  The Scala IO umbrella project consists of a few sub projects for different aspects and
  extensions of IO.  There are two main components of Scala IO:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core - Core primarily deals with Reading and writing data to and from arbitrary sources and sinks.  The corner stone traits are Input, Output and Seekable which provide the core API.  Other classes of importance are Resource, ReadChars and WriteChars.
    </li>
    <li>File - File is a File (called Path) API that is based on a combination of Java 7 NIO filesystem and SBT PathFinder APIs.  Path and FileSystem are the main entry points into the Scala IO File API.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  As an example of what Scala IO brings to the table the following examples compare Java IO vs Scala IO performing
  a simple task of reading data from two URLs and writing them to a file. (I found it amusing that I actually messed up
  the Java example the first try and had to debug it).
    <h3>Scala</h3>
      <pre class="brush: scala">import java.net.URL
import scalax.io.Input.asInputConverter
import scalax.file.Path

object ScalaIOExample extends App {
  val scalalang = new URL(&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org&quot;).asInput.bytes
  val scalatools = new URL(&quot;http://www.scala-tools.org&quot;).asInput.bytes

  Path(&quot;scalaout&quot;).write(scalalang ++ scalatools)
}</pre>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <pre class="brush: scala">import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URL;

public class JavaIOExample {
    public static void write(FileOutputStream out, String urlString) throws Exception {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[8192];
        URL url = new URL(urlString);
        InputStream in1 = url.openStream();
        try {
            int read = in1.read(buffer);
            while (read &gt; -1) {
                out.write(buffer,0,read);
                read = in1.read(buffer);
            }
        } finally {
            in1.close();
        }

    }
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(&quot;javaout&quot;);
        try {
            write(out,&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org&quot;);
            write(out,&quot;http://www.scala-tools.org&quot;);
        } finally {
            out.close();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
    </p>

    <em>Warning:</em> I have spent no time on optimization so there are a large number of
    known inefficiencies.  I have started to write a suite of performance tests to track and measure the performance and the performance should begin to improve from this point forward.
