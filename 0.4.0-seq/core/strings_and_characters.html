    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Writing Strings and characters require that codec object is passed to the Output object so that means the &quot;normal&quot; typeclass design cannot be used to implicitely write characters and strings to the Output.  Because of this write,patch,insert,etc...  are overloaded with a typeclass version as well as a version that takes a string.  <p> The result is that writing strings is a simple exercise but writing characters or Traversables of characters is less trivial.  The examples below show how to write strings and characters.  </p> </span></span></div>
