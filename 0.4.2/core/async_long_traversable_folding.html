    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Process only a portion of a file asynchronously.  A common case is to only process a portion of a file.  For example suppose we want the 5th record.  a record size is in the header so we have to read the header for the offset and jump to the 5th record.  <p> In truth this sort of processing is what the processing API was designed for but it can be done using the normal LongTraversable API as well using the fold methods </p> </span></span></div>
