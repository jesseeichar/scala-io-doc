  <p>In order ensure that Scala-IO will be a performant library there are an ever growing suite of tests that are designed to measure the performance of a particular IO operation performed by Scala-IO.</p>
  <p>In addition to the simple measurement is the "ideal" implementation which is a java based implementation that is the best possible implementation.  Scala-IO isn't really intended to reach that performance goal but it should constantly approach that goal.</p>
  <p>Also, to keep us honest, there is a history of the performance.  Hopefully that will track steadily improving performance characteristics</p>
