<strong>Scala IO Core</strong>
<p>Scala IO Core will be completed before much more work is done on the FS API so that the library
won't be forever being developed.  In addition to the major items listed below the common task of
improving API and removing inconsistency will always be a focus.  As will performance.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Implement Java 7 Implementations</strong>
        <div>We need a Java 7 implementation to make sure that various aspects of the Scala-io API integrate nicely.
        Especially Async API and Seekable channels.</div>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Deepen the Async APIs</strong>
        <div>The Java 7 implementation will no doubt show some shortcomings of the current API.  Scala-io needs
        to be able to use the Java 7 APIs so that the underlying OS async io capabilities can be used instead of
        blocking threads.</div>
    </li>
</ol>
<strong>Scala IO File</strong>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Watch Functionality</strong>
        <div>
            Add functionality that monitors filesystem for changes
        </div>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Plugin system</strong>
        <div>
            Filesystem plugin system. Will be compatible with Java 7 API and hopefully scala-io can be Java 7 plugins
            and scala-io should be able to use Java 7 plugins as well.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Implement based on Java 7</strong></li>
</ol>
