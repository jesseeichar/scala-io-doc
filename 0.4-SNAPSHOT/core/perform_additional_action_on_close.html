    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Perform additional actions when a resource is closed.  One of the important features of the Scala IO is that resources are cleaned up automatically.  However occasionally one would like to perform an action on close in addition to the default closing/flushing of the resource.  This can be done by updating the ResourceContext of the Resource with a new CloseAction or multiple CloseActions </span></span></div> 
    <div class="example_code"><pre class="brush: scala">
    import scalax.io._
    import scalax.io.managed.InputStreamResource

    // a close action can be created by passing a function to execute
    // to the Closer object's apply method
    // '''WARNING''' When defining a CloseAction make its type as generic
    // as possible.  IE if it can be a CloseAction[Closeable] do not
    // make it a CloseAction[InputStream].  The reason has to do
    // with contravariance.  If you don't know what that means
    // don't worry just trust me ;-)
    val closer = CloseAction{(channel:Any) =&gt;
      println(&quot;About to close &quot;+channel)
    }

    // another option is the extend/implement the CloseAction trait
    val closer2 = new CloseAction[Any]{

      protected def closeImpl(a: Any):List[Throwable] = {
        println(&quot;Message from second closer&quot;)
        Nil
      }
    }

    // closers can naturally be combined
    val closerThenCloser2 = closer +: closer2
    val closer2ThenCloser = closer :+ closer2

    // we can then create a resource and pass it to the closer parameter
    // now each time resource is used (and closed) the closer will also be executed
    // just before the actual closing.
    val resource = Resource.fromFile(&quot;file&quot;).addCloseAction(closer)
