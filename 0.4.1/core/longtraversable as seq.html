    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Since a input source is typically a sequence of bytes (file, inputstream etc...) it is tempting to treat them as a scala Seq or Iterable.  However the scala Seq and Iterable classes have methods that are either difficult to implement on a stream of unknown size or are simply dangerous since they can result in resource leaking.  In particular iterator is extremely likely to result in leaked resources.  <p> However there are several methods that not in the typical scala Traversable trait which logically apply to a input source.  The following examples demonstrate several such methods.  </p> </span></span></div>
