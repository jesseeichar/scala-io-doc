    <div class="example_summary"><span><span> Create Unmanaged resources.  <p>It is not the common case but sometimes one wants to use the scala-io API on resources that that should not be closed like Standard in/out/err.  Resource has factory methods for creating Resources that will not be closed when an action is finished.  All methods that do not close the resource contain the term Peristent.  For example fromUnmanagedStream</p> </span></span></div>

    val stdIn:Input = System.in.asUnmanagedInput
    val stdOut:Output = System.out.asUnmanagedOutput
    val stdErr:WriteChars = new OutputStreamWriter(System.err).asUnmanagedWriteChars
